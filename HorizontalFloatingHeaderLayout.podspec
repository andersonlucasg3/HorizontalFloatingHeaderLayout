  s.description      = <<-DESC
  HorizontalFLoatingHeaderLayout is a subclass of UICollectionViewLayout built with performance in mind. Born from the need for replicating UITableView's sticky headers behavior and iOS 8+ native Emoji keyboard.

For a vertical implementation, you can turn on *sectionHeadersPinToVisibleBounds* flag from UICollectionViewFlowLayout (available since iOS 9.0)
